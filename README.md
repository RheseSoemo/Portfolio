# Welcome to Rhese Soemo's Portfolio
This repository holds a portfolio of coding snippets and screenshots of programming projects that I have worked on as a software developer.

Inside this repository there are multiple .md files that each contain a different project's screenshots and code snippets. Where I can, I will link out to deployed projects or their repositories. You can navigate to them manually or you can use the helpful links below.
