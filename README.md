# Welcome to Rhese Soemo's Portfolio
This repository holds a portfolio of coding snippets and screenshots of programming projects that I have worked on as a software developer.

Inside this repository there are multiple .md files that each contain a different project's screenshots and code snippets. Where I can, I will link out to deployed projects or their repositories. You can navigate to them manually or you can use the helpful links below.

## Corperate Projects
I have worked on various projects as part of my technology career. For projects that I am not bound by NDA, have appropriate permission, or have the ability to show off a public frontend/release, I add them to the list below. In each project post, I will add the employer that I developed the project under.
* [WordPress Websites](/WordPress%20Websites.md) - These projects were developed for clients while employed at Big Guy Digital as a website developer on the WordPress CMS.

## Academic Projects
From 2020 to 2023 I earned my Bachelors of Science in Software Development at Grand Canyon University, or GCU. GCU's technology programs focuses on teaching in practical implementations. Their software development degree is no exception. In almost every class, I built a programming project from the ground up using the technology stack I was learning in the course. Consequently, I have added as many of my class projects as I can to the portfolio. I also participated in extracurricular technology activities, primarily in GCU's Research Design Program, also known as RDP.

* [Senior Capstone Project](/IndividualEntries/Academic/GrandCanyonUniversity/SeniorCapstoneProject.md) - Built a GUI driven application on C#, .NET, and Avalonia UI to solve a problem that I found in the small business sector.

### Research and Development Projects
* [AI-Enabled Medical Software](/IndividualEntries/Academic/RDP/AIMedicalSoftware.md) - Joined a team, led by Dr. Isac Artzi in building AI-Enabled Medical Software in Python

### Class Projects
*Please note that according to GCU's Technology College's Academic Policy, I am not allowed to publicly post repositories of my class work in order to prevent cheating. Consequently, for programs and applications developed in GCU classrooms, I can only show small code snippets and images of the final project.*
* [Social Media Blog](/Social%20Media%20Blog.md) - Led a team in creating a social media blogging website utilizing PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, and Azure
* [Minesweeper Applications](/Minesweeper%20Applications.md) - Designed and Built Minesweeper using C# on the .NET Framework using Object Oriented Principals

## Personal Projects
I have a deep passion for technology and using it to find solutions to everyday problems. Consequently, I am constantly coming up with ideas new projects and attempting to creating them. Sometimes I believe the project is in a state where it runs decently enough and is helpful enough that it could help others. Thus I open source it and maintain it publicly on a GIT repository. Any of these publicly maintained projects are listed below.
* [Null Core](/Null%20Core.md) - Created a library framework to quicken development of Minecraft Spigot mods
